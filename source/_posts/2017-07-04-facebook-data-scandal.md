Short answer: no.

Long answer: no.

I _still_ receive almost daily emails regarding the "Facebook Data Scandal." I watched intently as Zuck went before the judiciary to beg and grovel for something that shouldn't really have been an issue. I wrung my hands as the European Commission considered introducing stronger privacy legislation, which would make my job as a software engineer and entrepreneur even more difficult than it already is.

Some clarifications:
- I despise Facebook. Do I have an account? Yes. When did I last use it? Over eight years ago.
- Is personal privacy important to me? Probably moreso than most. Yes, you know who I am...but I'm very careful about the information I release and where I identify myself.

Why am I defending Facebook? Well, I'm not trying to defend facebook so much as I am trying to assault ignorance, stupidity, and blindness. These ever-more-pervasive qualities are distorting the conversation around what happened in several ways.

## Misinformation ##

Much of the news circulated about the "Facebook Data Scandal" involved a heaping helping of misinformation. While not wholly misinformed, many points about Facebook violating individual privacy were entirely misinformed. Facebook was both entirely within their legal right, as well as entirely honest about the distribution of their users' information.

The real crime here is that society has devolved to the point of believing that an individual can give all their personal and private information, photos, and most intimate inner thoughts to another individual or organization and keep it perfectly private. We treat the thousands of our "Facebook Friends" as though they were our closest, sharing with them information they needn't know, or don't want to know.

Consider that I have given Facebook my political thoughts, I have read the fine print (can't express how ridiculous it is that people don't read this), and I know that Facebook can do whatever they want with my data. Problem solved. I no longer give Facebook any information I don't want them to use.

## Facebook Already Did Most of this Before ##

1. We already know that Facebook [collects a mammoth amount of information on us](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/facebook-knows-literally-everything-about-you/). This includes information about phone calls and text messages. Everybody hates the NSA/CSIS for this behaviour, but willingly give Facebook this information. Cognitive dissonance.
2. [Facebook builds shadow profiles](https://gizmodo.com/how-facebook-figures-out-everyone-youve-ever-met-1819822691) of everybody you've ever met, even if they're not a Facebook user.
3. When you install a Facebook app, it asks for permission to invade every facet of your mobile privacy, and most folks agree to it. This includes WhatsApp and Instagram. And all this information is collated to provide a full picture of the individual using the services.
4. Facebook has been targeting ads for ages. Why are we all so incensed about this? It's not like other technology behemoths don't...
