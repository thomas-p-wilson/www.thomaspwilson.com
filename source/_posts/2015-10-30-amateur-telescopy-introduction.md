We use telescopes every day. Cameras often use refracting telescopes for their
lenses. Ornithologists use binoculars. Most important to us though: astronomers
use telescopes to explore the reaches of the galaxy that we can't yet physically
reach. Some astronomical and scientific telescopes capture amazingly detailed
portraits of galaxies, solar systems, planets, and other cosmic entities.

*Telescopy* is the art of study of making and operating telescopes. Some folks
enjoy using telescopes to explore the universe. Others enjoy building
telescopes. Yet others enjoy both. This series will concentrate on the effort
of producing a telescope. We'll begin with theory and move on to practical
implementation of that theory.
