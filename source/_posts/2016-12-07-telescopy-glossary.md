- *Angular Resolution*<a id="angular-resolution"></a> is the minimum distance required between two objects in order for an optical device to distinguish them as separate. Related to [Resolving Power](#resolving-power).
- Aperture
- Astigmatism
- Catadioptric
- Catoptric
- Chromatic Aberration
- Coma
- Dioptric
- Distortion
- Field Curvature
- Focal Length
- Focal Ratio
- Lens Sag
- Mirror Sag
- *Objective*: The lens at the front end of a dioptric system, or the large primary mirror of a catoptric or catadioptric system. Light-gathering power and image resolution increases with the size of the objective.
- Reflective (see Catoptric)
- Refractive (see Dioptric)
- *Resolving Power* is the ability of a device to separate two objects that are located far from the device but close together.
- Spherical Aberration
